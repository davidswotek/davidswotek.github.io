    "section": "",
    "text": "Nebraska loves to love sports. Any sport involving the Nebraska Cornhuskers will get small-town fans jumping for joy to the big-city folks arguing at the tailgate. However, there is one sport in Nebraska that people seem to be stuck in the past. Football.\nNebraska has had quite the past with football, especially with Tom Osborne leading the team back in the day. But now, they seem to have hit a dry spot with a head coach savior. Two recent coaches, Mike Riley and Scott Frost, seemed to have all the answers, but now that both have been fired after their underwhelming performances, it’s clear that was not the case.\nPeople argue about how terrible Nebraska head coaches are for football, but which one in recent years was the worst? Mike Riley and Scott Frost created lots of conversation in disappointment across the state, so focusing on their time with the Cornhuskers may settle some arguments.\nFirst, Nebraska’s rushing game has always been a strong strategy. However, Riley seemed to struggle in this area.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(gt)\n\noffense2015 &lt;- read_csv(\"offense2015.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2015, TeamSeason = paste(School, Season), Era = \"Riley\")\n\noffense2016 &lt;- read_csv(\"offense2016.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2016, TeamSeason = paste(School, Season), Era = \"Riley\")\n\noffense2017 &lt;- read_csv(\"offense2017.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2017, TeamSeason = paste(School, Season), Era = \"Riley\")\n\noffense2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"offense2018.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2018, TeamSeason = paste(School, Season), Era = \"Frost\")\n\noffense2019 &lt;- read_csv(\"offense2019.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2019, TeamSeason = paste(School, Season), Era = \"Frost\")\n\noffense2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"offense2020.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2020, TeamSeason = paste(School, Season), Era = \"Frost\")\n\noffense2021 &lt;- read_csv(\"offense2021.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2021, TeamSeason = paste(School, Season), Era = \"Frost\")\n\noffense &lt;- bind_rows(offense2015, offense2016, offense2017, offense2018, offense2019, offense2020, offense2021)\n\nnu &lt;- offense |&gt; filter(School == \"Nebraska\")\n\nbiglist &lt;- c(\"Illinois\", \"Indiana\", \"Iowa\", \"Maryland\", \"Michigan\", \"Michigan State\", \"Minnesota\", \"Nebraska\", \"Northwestern\", \"Ohio State\", \"Penn State\", \"Purdue\", \"Rutgers\", \"Wisconsin\")\n\nbig &lt;- offense |&gt; filter(School %in% biglist)\n\nbigavgrushing &lt;- big |&gt;\n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  summarize(mean_rushing_yds=mean(RushingYds))\n\nnuplays2015 &lt;- c(\"RushingAtt\"=38.2, \"PassingAtt\"=35.2)\nnuplays2016 &lt;- c(\"RushingAtt\"=40.2, \"PassingAtt\"=30.8, 2.4)\nnuplays2017 &lt;- c(\"RushingAtt\"=30.7, \"PassingAtt\"=38.3, 4.4)\nnuplays2018 &lt;- c(\"RushingAtt\"=38.7, \"PassingAtt\"=33.7, 1)\nnuplays2019 &lt;- c(\"RushingAtt\"=45.0, \"PassingAtt\"=26.9, 1.5)\nnuplays2020 &lt;- c(\"RushingAtt\"=41.8, \"PassingAtt\"=28.6, 3)\nnuplays2021 &lt;- c(\"RushingAtt\"=40.8, \"PassingAtt\"=28.5, 4.1)\n\nnutable &lt;- nu |&gt; \n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  select(Season, Era, Fum, Int, TurnoversTot) |&gt; \n  arrange(TurnoversTot) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=big, aes(x=Season, y=RushingYds, group=School), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_line(data=nu, aes(x=Season, y=RushingYds, color=Era, group=School), size=1) +\n  geom_line(data=bigavgrushing, aes(x=Season, y=mean_rushing_yds, group=1), color=\"black\", size=1) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019, y=155), color=\"black\", label = \"Avg.

Riley liked to focus on getting the ball in the air to get the larger gains. Frost preferred to get a few yards every play and trickle down the clock while powering down the field.\nWith these different mindsets, there was one thing that both coaches definitely agreed with. Nebraska turnovers need to be stopped.\nHusker fans know better than anyone that Nebraska seems to turn the ball over quite a lot. Riley and Frost had their different strategies, and with that came different outcomes in the turnover output.\n\n\nCode\nnutable |&gt; \n  arrange(TurnoversTot) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Fum = \"FumPerGame\",\n    Int = \"IntPerGame\",\n    TurnoversTot = \"TurnoversPerGame\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Nebraska turnovers are always a worry\",\n    subtitle = \"Riley's teams did much better, but did have an outlier since he favored passing.\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** David Swotek  |  **Source:** Sports-Reference.com\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt; \n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Season == 2015)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska turnovers are always a worry\n\n\nRiley's teams did much better, but did have an outlier since he favored passing.\n\n\nSeason\nEra\nFumPerGame\nIntPerGame\nTurnoversPerGame\n\n\n\n\n2016\nRiley\n0.4\n0.7\n1.1\n\n\n2021\nFrost\n0.6\n0.9\n1.5\n\n\n2017\nRiley\n0.2\n1.4\n1.6\n\n\n2018\nFrost\n0.9\n0.9\n1.8\n\n\n2019\nFrost\n1.0\n0.8\n1.8\n\n\n2015\nRiley\n0.5\n1.6\n2.1\n\n\n2020\nFrost\n1.1\n1.1\n2.3\n\n\n\nBy: David Swotek | Source: Sports-Reference.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite Riley throwing the ball much more, he seemed to keep the ball in Nebraka’s possession more often. Frost lowered the number of interceptions per game since he didn’t throw the ball as often, but running the ball doesn’t guarantee the ball won’t pop out for a defensive scoop.\nThe Cornhuskers have been looking for a savior for so long in the head coach spot. These two coaches back-to-back really tested the loyalty of Husker fans. As always, the fans powered through the tough times. Riley and Frost fought to keep their reputations clean, and both struggled to do so.\nHowever, at the end of the day, with one less season, Riley did have more overall wins for Nebraska. The fans just want enough of those wins to get to a bowl game. Hopefully, Matt Rhule can bring Husker nation back to the promise land."

    "text": "March is full of madness. Around the middle of the month, people are spending quite a lot of money on booze and brackets. Maybe it gives them confidence? Everyone has their own way of scraping all the luck they can get out of the pot of gold to have the perfect bracket. However, back in 2022, there was one team that easily destroyed a huge portion of brackets, and no one saw it coming.\nThe Saint Peter’s Peacocks were on full display for the world to see. The private university from Jersey City, New Jersey, is 3-5 in the NCAA Men’s March Madness game, and all three victories occurred in 2022. The Peacocks beat Kentucky, the number two seed and an easy favorite to win the tournament, in the first round.\nSaint Peter’s surprised everyone, and maybe even themselves. The 2022 tournament run for the team was incredible, and not a single team thought they would make it past the first round.\nFirst, the Simple Rating System from Sports Reference takes into account average point differentials and the strength of season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(scales)\n\nseason2021stats &lt;- read_csv(\"season2021stats.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2021) |&gt; mutate(School = gsub(\" NCAA\", \"\", School))\n\nseason2022stats &lt;- read_csv(\"season2022stats.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2022) |&gt; mutate(School = gsub(\" NCAA\", \"\", School))\n\nseason2023stats &lt;- read_csv(\"season2023stats.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2023) |&gt; mutate(School = gsub(\" NCAA\", \"\", School))\n\neliteeightexpenses &lt;- read_csv(\"eliteeightexpenses.csv\")\n\nseasons &lt;- bind_rows(season2021stats, season2022stats, season2023stats)\n\nsp &lt;- seasons |&gt; filter(School == \"Saint Peter's\")\n\nsp2022expenses &lt;- eliteeightexpenses |&gt; filter(`Institution Name` == \"Saint Peter's\")\n\neight2022list &lt;- c(\"North Carolina\", \"Kansas\", \"Miami (FL)\", \"Saint Peter's\", \"Arkansas\", \"Duke\", \"Houston\", \"Villanova\")\n\neight2022 &lt;- season2022stats |&gt; filter(School %in% eight2022list)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=seasons, aes(x=Season, y=SRS, group=School), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_line(data=sp, aes(x=Season, y=SRS, group=School),size = 1, color=\"#0072CE\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2022) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2021, 2022, 2023)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Simple Rating System\", \n    title=\"Saint Peter's went up and then right back down\", \n    subtitle=\"The team found a way to fight with the big dogs, but it didn't last long.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By David Swotek\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaint Peter’s jumped the ranks, going from 213th in 2021 to 120th in 2022, nearly half the rank the year before. But for all the Peacock haters out there, the team dropped to 305th in 2023, so no need to freak out.\nThere are lots of reasons for people to doubt Saint Peter’s. They were 15th seeded. The team hasn’t been to the tournament in eleven years. Also, the team was not great at keeping the fouls low.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = eight2022,\n    aes(y=reorder(School, PF), x=FT, xend=PF),\n    size = 2,\n    color = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Free Throws vs Personal Fouls\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"Intense foul trouble among the Elite Eight in 2022\", \n    subtitle=\"Saint Peter's led the Elite Eight in &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;personal fouls&lt;/span&gt; with not many &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;free throws&lt;/span&gt; to balance it out.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By David Swotek\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaint Peter’s racked up 669 personal fouls over the season, which is wild. On the opposite side, Duke, who made it to the Final Four but lost to North Carolina, committed 532 personal fouls, a 137 foul difference.\nMost of these big-name teams have been in the basketball spotlight for a while. When people think about Duke, North Carolina, Kansas, etc., they think of basketball.\nBecause of this, these schools have to keep the programs thriving with new gyms, equipment, jerseys, marketing, and everything in between. The budgets of these schools are all crazy high, except for one school.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=eliteeightexpenses, aes(x=reorder(`Institution Name`,`Basketball Men's Team Expenses`), weight=`Basketball Men's Team Expenses`), fill = \"grey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=sp2022expenses, aes(x=reorder(`Institution Name`,`Basketball Men's Team Expenses`), weight=`Basketball Men's Team Expenses`), fill = \"#0072CE\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Expenses for the Elite Eight Teams in 2022\",\n    subtitle=\"Spending more doesn't always mean more success because Saint Peter's is dead last.\",\n    caption=\"Source: U.S. Department of Education | By David Swotek\",\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Expenses\"\n) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next smallest budget above Saint Peter’s is North Carolina, and their budget is over five times the amount of the Peacocks. Saint Peter’s did not have the most state-of-the-art setup for the basketball program, but the team found a way to weave in the Elite Eight and got their spotlight moment.\nSaint Peter’s surprised everyone and gave sports broadcasters plenty to talk about in 2022. The Peacocks made the tournament again this year but didn’t quite have the same outcome. They lost to Tennessee in the first round. So, a trip to the Elite Eight or further again will take a lot of luck once again, or maybe just some more practice."
