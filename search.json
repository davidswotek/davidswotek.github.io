    "section": "",
    "text": "Nebraska loves to love sports. Any sport involving the Nebraska Cornhuskers will get small-town fans jumping for joy to the big-city folks arguing at the tailgate. However, there is one sport in Nebraska that people seem to be stuck in the past. Football.\nNebraska has had quite the past with football, especially with Tom Osborne leading the team back in the day. But now, they seem to have hit a dry spot with a head coach savior. Two recent coaches, Mike Riley and Scott Frost, seemed to have all the answers, but now that both have been fired after their underwhelming performances, it’s clear that was not the case.\nPeople argue about how terrible Nebraska head coaches are for football, but which one in recent years was the worst? Mike Riley and Scott Frost created lots of conversation in disappointment across the state, so focusing on their time with the Cornhuskers may settle some arguments.\nFirst, Nebraska’s rushing game has always been a strong strategy. However, Riley seemed to struggle in this area.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(gt)\n\noffense2015 &lt;- read_csv(\"offense2015.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2015, TeamSeason = paste(School, Season), Era = \"Riley\")\n\noffense2016 &lt;- read_csv(\"offense2016.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2016, TeamSeason = paste(School, Season), Era = \"Riley\")\n\noffense2017 &lt;- read_csv(\"offense2017.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2017, TeamSeason = paste(School, Season), Era = \"Riley\")\n\noffense2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"offense2018.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2018, TeamSeason = paste(School, Season), Era = \"Frost\")\n\noffense2019 &lt;- read_csv(\"offense2019.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2019, TeamSeason = paste(School, Season), Era = \"Frost\")\n\noffense2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"offense2020.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2020, TeamSeason = paste(School, Season), Era = \"Frost\")\n\noffense2021 &lt;- read_csv(\"offense2021.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2021, TeamSeason = paste(School, Season), Era = \"Frost\")\n\noffense &lt;- bind_rows(offense2015, offense2016, offense2017, offense2018, offense2019, offense2020, offense2021)\n\nnu &lt;- offense |&gt; filter(School == \"Nebraska\")\n\nbiglist &lt;- c(\"Illinois\", \"Indiana\", \"Iowa\", \"Maryland\", \"Michigan\", \"Michigan State\", \"Minnesota\", \"Nebraska\", \"Northwestern\", \"Ohio State\", \"Penn State\", \"Purdue\", \"Rutgers\", \"Wisconsin\")\n\nbig &lt;- offense |&gt; filter(School %in% biglist)\n\nbigavgrushing &lt;- big |&gt;\n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  summarize(mean_rushing_yds=mean(RushingYds))\n\nnuplays2015 &lt;- c(\"RushingAtt\"=38.2, \"PassingAtt\"=35.2)\nnuplays2016 &lt;- c(\"RushingAtt\"=40.2, \"PassingAtt\"=30.8, 2.4)\nnuplays2017 &lt;- c(\"RushingAtt\"=30.7, \"PassingAtt\"=38.3, 4.4)\nnuplays2018 &lt;- c(\"RushingAtt\"=38.7, \"PassingAtt\"=33.7, 1)\nnuplays2019 &lt;- c(\"RushingAtt\"=45.0, \"PassingAtt\"=26.9, 1.5)\nnuplays2020 &lt;- c(\"RushingAtt\"=41.8, \"PassingAtt\"=28.6, 3)\nnuplays2021 &lt;- c(\"RushingAtt\"=40.8, \"PassingAtt\"=28.5, 4.1)\n\nnutable &lt;- nu |&gt; \n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  select(Season, Era, Fum, Int, TurnoversTot) |&gt; \n  arrange(TurnoversTot) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=big, aes(x=Season, y=RushingYds, group=School), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_line(data=nu, aes(x=Season, y=RushingYds, color=Era, group=School), size=1) +\n  geom_line(data=bigavgrushing, aes(x=Season, y=mean_rushing_yds, group=1), color=\"black\", size=1) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019, y=155), color=\"black\", label = \"Avg.

Riley liked to focus on getting the ball in the air to get the larger gains. Frost preferred to get a few yards every play and trickle down the clock while powering down the field.\nWith these different mindsets, there was one thing that both coaches definitely agreed with. Nebraska turnovers need to be stopped.\nHusker fans know better than anyone that Nebraska seems to turn the ball over quite a lot. Riley and Frost had their different strategies, and with that came different outcomes in the turnover output.\n\n\nCode\nnutable |&gt; \n  arrange(TurnoversTot) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Fum = \"FumPerGame\",\n    Int = \"IntPerGame\",\n    TurnoversTot = \"TurnoversPerGame\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Nebraska turnovers are always a worry\",\n    subtitle = \"Riley's teams did much better, but did have an outlier since he favored passing.\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** David Swotek  |  **Source:** Sports-Reference.com\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt; \n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Season == 2015)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska turnovers are always a worry\n\n\nRiley's teams did much better, but did have an outlier since he favored passing.\n\n\nSeason\nEra\nFumPerGame\nIntPerGame\nTurnoversPerGame\n\n\n\n\n2016\nRiley\n0.4\n0.7\n1.1\n\n\n2021\nFrost\n0.6\n0.9\n1.5\n\n\n2017\nRiley\n0.2\n1.4\n1.6\n\n\n2018\nFrost\n0.9\n0.9\n1.8\n\n\n2019\nFrost\n1.0\n0.8\n1.8\n\n\n2015\nRiley\n0.5\n1.6\n2.1\n\n\n2020\nFrost\n1.1\n1.1\n2.3\n\n\n\nBy: David Swotek | Source: Sports-Reference.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite Riley throwing the ball much more, he seemed to keep the ball in Nebraka’s possession more often. Frost lowered the number of interceptions per game since he didn’t throw the ball as often, but running the ball doesn’t guarantee the ball won’t pop out for a defensive scoop.\nThe Cornhuskers have been looking for a savior for so long in the head coach spot. These two coaches back-to-back really tested the loyalty of Husker fans. As always, the fans powered through the tough times. Riley and Frost fought to keep their reputations clean, and both struggled to do so.\nHowever, at the end of the day, with one less season, Riley did have more overall wins for Nebraska. The fans just want enough of those wins to get to a bowl game. Hopefully, Matt Rhule can bring Husker nation back to the promise land."
